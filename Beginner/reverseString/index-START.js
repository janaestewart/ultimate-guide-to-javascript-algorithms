/* CHALLENGE
Given a string of text, write an algorithm that returns the text received in a reversed format. 
E.g reverseString('algorithms') // should return 'smhtirogla'
*/

// The process here is quite simple and straight forward. Our function will receive only one parameter i.e the string to be reversed.
// Next, we would have to manipulate the characters in this string logically in order to return the string in reverse.

//There are four ways to solve this challenge

    //chaining in-built methods

        //text.split('').reverse().join('')
        
        //The **.split()** method is used to split a string into an array of characters. It receives one argument which specifies the separator that determines where every split occurs.

        // The .reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array.

        //The **.join()** method is used to combine the elements of an array into a string. It receives one argument which specifies the separator. When none is supplied, it defaults to a comma.

        function reverseString(text) {
            return text.split('').reverse().join('')
        }

    //using a for-loop

        //For loops are used to execute a piece of code as long as a condition is met. In the solution below, we use a decrementing for-loop to run through the string received and append each character to another variable in reverse order.

        function reverseString(text) {
            let result = ''

            for(let i = text.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                result += text[i]
            }
            
            return result
        } 

        //Notice how we initialize the iterating variable i to the length of the string -1 . Since the index begins from zero, this gives us the index of the last character in the string. We simply append this last character to our result variable which is an empty string and continue the cycle until we are past the first character of the string i.e i is no longer greater than or equal to 0.

        //we can also use for...of in ES6

            // The forâ€¦of statement in JavaScript is used to execute a certain piece of code for each distinct item(property) of an iterable object.
        
            function reverseString(text){
                let result = ''

                for(let char of text){
                    result = char + result
                }
                return result
            }


    //recursion method

        //Recursion is a programming technique in which the intention is to reduce the problem into smaller instances of the same problem until it is completely solved.

        function reverseString(text){
            if(text === ''){
                return ''
            } else {
                return reverseString(text.substr(1)) + text[0]
            }
        }

        //we make use of the .substr() method in JavaScript to return a portion of the text received. It expects two parameters, one specifying the starting index and the other specifying the number of characters afterwards(optional)

    //using .reduce()

function reverseString(text) {
